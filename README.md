WOODBRIDGE, Va., -- The Potomac Nationals – a minor league baseball club in suburban Washington– are an example of a question facing the country’s 160 baseball communities: Should local taxpayers pay the multimillion-dollar price tags for modern stadiums that would lure or keep minor league teams in their towns?


Many economists argue that spending money on building ballparks does not return to the community. Team owners say that new stadiums create jobs building and operating the facility, but most of those positions are seasonal. Sports also can bring excitement to a community, but only a sliver of residents may care. Economists worry that the interests of a few impact everyone financially.


“A major league stadium generates roughly the same number of year round, full-time jobs as a large Macy’s department store,” Matheson said. “Minor league is going to generate maybe a tenth of that number. Most jobs being generated at the minor league level are very low level, part-time, minimum wage jobs.”


Potomac’s team, known at the P-Nats, the Class A Advanced affiliate of the Washington Nationals, play in Pfitzner Stadium, a 6,000-seat park in Woodbridge, Virginia, built in 1984 on county land.

Nicknamed the Pfitz, it is outdated with metal bleachers lining most of the stands and smaller than average dugouts. A growing ballpark trend is open concourses with concessions located behind the first level seating. The Pfitz’s food stands sit by the front gate and behind the bleachers. 


According to team owner Art Silber, Minor League Baseball told him the organization must have a new stadium by 2019 due to the Pfitz’s deteriorating state. 

Silber, former president and CEO of Sterling Bank in Baltimore, introduced drafts for a 6,000-seat ballpark in 2012 and said the team would pay for it by selling naming rights for $25 million. 


However, as the years passed, Silber wanted the county to fund the undertaking.


The proposed new location for the P-Nats is six miles away by the shopping complex Stonebridge at Potomac Town Center. Prince William County would issue bonds to fund building. The team would pay $2.7 million annual mortgage payments over 30 years and $450,000 per year for land rental. 


After delays in getting approval, Silber withdrew his stadium plan on July 13, just five days before the Prince William County Board of Supervisors was to vote on holding a public referendum for taxpayers to decide on funding the $35 million stadium.


“The Nationals and JBG [the team’s development group] would be the ones to benefit from this deal while the taxpayers assume the risk with it,” Supervisor Pete Candland said. 
	
Silber is looking for another city to be the team’s home.


The P-Nats aren’t the only minor league team demanding public funds to build a modern stadium. 


The Pawtucket Red Sox shocked fans when they asked for public funds to build a new $83 million stadium. The Triple-A affiliate of the Boston Red Sox divided the cost of the project by asking the city of Pawtucket to pay $15 million and the state of Rhode Island to cough up $23 million. The team would be responsible for $45 million.

The Rhode Island Senate Finance Committee plans to vote on the funding in the fall. 


In addition to local officials’ emphasis on the economic benefits of new stadiums, they also cite modern stadiums as amenities to attract new residents, according to UNC Charlotte Economics Professor Craig Depken. 


“Minor league teams are looking at themselves as big league teams with amenities like Wi-Fi or craft beer services,” Depken said. “Minor league baseball tends to be very localized. The amenity factor is important...because it does exist, it’s something for us to do.”


That’s how Norfolk, Virginia, looks at Harbor Park, home of the Norfolk Tides. 


The 12,000 seat stadium for the Baltimore Orioles’ Triple-A affiliate was built in 1993. It features an indoor restaurant and 24 suites. 


The city owns Harbor Park and signed a 15-year lease extension in 2013. 


In the 2017 offseason, Norfolk will invest $2.5 million in renovating the left field picnic pavilion, installing new LED stadium lights and expanding the box office. 


“They’re a part of the community just the way a major league club would be in a larger city, said John Rhamstine, Norfolk’s cultural, arts and entertainment director. “They bring people to downtown to eat and park and spend nights in our hotel rooms. So it’s an economic driver.”


The city has yet to look at the project’s construction bids to determine the number of construction jobs created by the renovations, according to Rhamstine’s office. 


Matheson says stadiums can enhance their neighborhood’s economy but hurt other areas of the city.


“It’s not like baseball stadiums create more people needing to eat,” Matheson said. “It just rearranges where people are eating in that city…That one sports bar dinner outside the stadium is one Italian dinner that’s not being made across town at that restaurant.”


Depken predicted fans will support these deals less when seeing how much they cost in tax dollars. 


The NFL’s Oakland Raiders’ move to Las Vegas is a recent example.


When Las Vegas polled residents in July 2016 on using around $500 million for the Raiders’ stadium, 55 percent opposed it. Only 35 percent were in favor, while 10 percent were undecided. 


In March, NFL team owners approved the Raiders’ move to Las Vegas, putting taxpayers on the hook for $750 million of the cost of a $1.7 billion stadium.


This is the reason economists like Matheson have an issue with the high amount of public funds used for stadiums. Everyone’s money is used on something not everyone wants.


“We do know that sports make people happy,” Matheson said. “So as long as you’re justifying a stadium saying this is an amenity for our town rather than an economic generator, most economists wouldn’t take issue with that. But when you say spending $30, 40, 50 million on a baseball stadium is good for the economy, we don’t have a lot of evidence that that’s true.”



Explanation: I became interested in writing an enterprise story on minor league stadium deals during the sports group’s minor league reporting project. The Potomac Nationals were the first team we vistited in late June, and they were waiting on the county’s approval for stadium funds. As a Class A Advanced team, I saw how outdated Pfitzner stadium was and understood why they needed a new one but not why they needed so much money. Minor league ballparks have historically been small and bland, especially the lower ranks like Class A.


While visiting the Norfolk Tides, I saw that they had a much nicer ballpark. But I also thought a bigger ballpark with more amenities made since for the Tides as a Triple A team; players’ last stop before the big leagues. 


I started researching how much new minor league stadiums across the country cost and what trends were influencing new ballpark designs. I was astounded by how much money minor league stadiums cost but couldn’t figure out why it mattered to have such expensive ballparks, prompting my decision to write on their use of public funds. I wanted economists to weigh in on whether or not the ballparks helped their communities financially.
